# Poker

My attempt at creating a No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker bot using Monte Carlo counterfactual regret minimization, as well as some optimization techniques

## Stages

1. Model the poker game
2. Implement some sort of algorithm
3. Generate a blueprint
4. Introduce abstraction for bet sizes and hands to optimize
